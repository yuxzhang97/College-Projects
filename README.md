## Bayesian Network for Image Recognition

A project focused on using Bayesian Networks for image recognition tasks. The code includes implementations for constructing and training Bayesian Networks to recognize patterns in images.

## Maze Solver

This project involves developing algorithms to solve mazes. Implementations of various maze-solving algorithms such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* are included.

## Pentomino Solver

In this project, I developed a solver for Pentomino puzzles. The code includes algorithms to solve Pentomino puzzles by placing Pentomino pieces on a board without overlapping.

## Q-Learning Snake Game

This project involves implementing a Snake game using Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. The Snake game learns to play itself using Q-Learning.

## Scripts for VR Game

This project consists of various scripts developed for a Virtual Reality (VR) game. These scripts include functionalities for player movement, interaction with objects, and game mechanics.
